It might help to think of the computer instructions as a detailed, step-by-step recipe for performing tasks. The instructions tell computers and machines how to perform an action. Programming code may also be referred to as source code or scripts.\n","\n","**Programming languages** - Programming languages are similar to human spoken languages in that they both use syntax and semantics. Programming languages are used to write computer programs.  Some common programming languages include Python, Java, C, C++, C#, and R.\n","\n","**Semantics** - Semantics refers to the intended meaning or effect of statements, or collections of words, in both human and computer languages. Semantic errors are also referred to as logical errors.\n","\n","**Script** - Scripts are usually shorter and less complex than computer programs. Scripts are often used to automate specific tasks. However, they can be used for complex tasks if needed. Scripts are often written by IT professionals, but anyone can learn to write scripts. Scripts have a shorter, less structured development cycle as compared to the development of complex computer programs and software. Scripts can be written in a variety of programming languages, like Python, Javascript, Ruby, Bash, and more. Some scripting languages are interpreted languages and are only compatible with certain platforms.\n","\n","**Automation** - Automation is used to replace a repetitive manual step with one that happens automatically.\n","\n","**Functions** - A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.\n","\n","**Variables** - Variables are used to temporarily store changeable values in programming code."],"metadata":{"id":"AG4GP_ldQ88N"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- ### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\n","\n","An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for software development.\n","\n","An IDE typically includes a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, a debugger, and other tools that are necessary for software development such as a source code control system, a version control system, and various other utilities."],"metadata":{"id":"MMkm54qnQ85f"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- ### Code Editor\n","\n","A code editor is a type of software application that is designed to help programmers write and edit source code.
